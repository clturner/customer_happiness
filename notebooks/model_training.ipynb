    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The features that emerged as the strongest predictors of customer happiness were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X1**: \"My order was delivered on time\"\n",
    "- **X3**: \"I ordered everything I wanted to order\"\n",
    "- **X4**: \"I paid a good price for my order\"\n",
    "- **X6**: \"The app makes ordering easy for me\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These four features were the most significant in predicting customer happiness. **X1** relates to timely delivery, **X3** reflects whether customers could order everything they wanted, **X4** captures perceptions of price fairness, and **X6** assesses ease of use of the ordering app. To refine the model further and gain more customer insights, the following additional questions could be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X1**: Add more detailed questions like, “How fast was the delivery?” to capture nuances in the delivery experience.\n",
    "- **X3**: A more specific survey question could ask whether product unavailability was due to stock issues or other factors, providing deeper insights into the reasons behind incomplete orders.\n",
    "- **X4**: Further questions could explore customer expectations of price, especially across different types of stores or product categories.\n",
    "- **X6**: Asking about additional aspects of the app experience, such as customer support or user interface satisfaction, could help understand app-related factors that influence customer happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges with Features\n",
    "\n",
    "While **X2**: \"Contents of my order were as expected\" and **X5**: \"I am satisfied with my courier\" were initially important features, they did not contribute as significantly as **X1**, **X3**, **X4**, and **X6** in the final model. However, customer satisfaction with order contents and couriers remains valuable and could be revisited in future surveys. Similarly, while price perception is relevant, it may be more insightful to explore pricing expectations across various types of stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Development and Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "I employed statistical tests (such as bar charts, box plots, and Pearson/Spearman correlations) to identify key features. Additionally, I tested multiple models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and others, alongside feature importance methods like **Permutation Importance** and **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ExtraTreesClassifier** outperformed all other models, achieving the best accuracy of **89.47%**. The best feature combination was **['X1', 'X3', 'X4', 'X6']**, which resulted in the following confusion matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This model predicted unhappy customers (class 0) with an accuracy of **90%** and happy customers (class 1) with an accuracy of **89%**, providing a highly accurate and balanced prediction of customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refine survey questions**: To enhance feature quality and model performance, consider adding more specific questions about delivery speed, order contents, and app experience. This will capture the finer details that distinguish happy from unhappy customers.\n",
    "- **Monitor class imbalance**: The models performed well in predicting unhappy customers (class 0), which is essential for addressing dissatisfaction. By focusing on converting unhappy customers into happy ones, significant business value can be unlocked.\n",
    "- **Further testing**: While the **ExtraTreesClassifier** performed excellently, additional classifiers and hyperparameter tuning would be beneficial to further optimize the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from this project provide actionable insights into customer satisfaction and suggest that refining survey questions and model features could lead to even more accurate predictions. These findings can help businesses improve customer experience, optimize resources, and develop strategies to convert unhappy customers into happy ones, driving overall business success.\n",
